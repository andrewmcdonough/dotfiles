# Andrew McDonough's Configuration Files

I'm in the process of cleaning up my dotfiles, and decided to start with a clean repository. I'm slowly cleaning up years of config bloat, and copying configurations across one at a time.

## Installation

Clone the repo into ~/dotfiles, then run the install script. This symlinks the config files in your home directory.

```
sh install.sh
```
